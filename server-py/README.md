## Setup

Youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTx18uyyHw8&t=1s

Install `pyenv` for your operating system to control the python version `3.12.1` which will be used for this project. The .python-version file controls the current version of python we are using.

Run the command to install the local virtualenv `python -m venv .venv`

To install new pip packages run  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you are using an IDE other than VSCode, like pycharm, make sure to include the IDE specific settings folder in the .gitignore


## Goals
Implement a simple rate limiter in python with a UI that can toggle between 5 different techniques.

UI should also allow user to edit the amount of requests for a given time frame.

UI will be in a separate React Project which will be linked here when created.

Unit tests and stress testing will also be applied to tests large requests.

Future developement would entail running this in a multi server cloud based environment.

Refer to issues for work that needs to be done.

Refer to project board for and wiki for additonal details on development.
