## Goals
Implement a simple rate limiter in python with a UI that can toggle between 5 different techniques.

UI should also allow user to edit the amount of requests for a given time frame.

UI will be in a separate React Project which will be linked here when created.

Unit tests and stress testing will also be applied to tests large requests.

Future developement would entail running this in a multi server cloud based environment.

Refer to issues for work that needs to be done.

Refer to project board for and wiki for additonal details on development.
